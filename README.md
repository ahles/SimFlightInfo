# Whereismyplane üõ© üåç

Whereismyplane is a Desktop-App that listens to the position information sent by [X-Plane](https://www.x-plane.com/) and displays the current location on a openstreetmap.

You can try this app in simulation mode without X-Plane.

## Installation & Usage

Install this app on a second computer in the same network as you're using X-Plane.

You can download and install the [latest release](https://github.com/ahles/whereismyplane/releases/latest) (win & mac).

Or you can build your own for your operating system following the development & build instructions at the bottom of this document.

## Configure X-Plane

You need to instruct X-Plane to send the positional data (globalposition) over UDP 49000 to the IP of the computer in your local network where this app is installed:

- In X-Plane open the settings and go to the tab "Data Output".
- Activate the checkbox "Network via UDP" for the Index 20 "Latitude, Longitude & Altitude".
- On the right side under "Network Configuration" activate the checkbox "Send network data output"
- Select "Enter IP-Address", if necessary
- Enter the IP Adress of the computer this app is installed (f.e 192.168.1.11)
- Enter Port number 4900
- Above under "Output rates" I recommend setting the "UDP Rate" to 1.0 packets/s or slower
- Klick done
